v3.9.1 [2022.11.27] [KdL's Updates!] [REPACK]

- Updated some scripts, now the entire multi-release group is aborted if a single task fails.
- Improved IPL-ROM to use many more brands of SD cards, new animated icons and minor fixes, by HRA! and me.
- Improved PS/2 keyboard controller for the 2nd Gen machines with expanded compatibility, by HRA!
  ### NOTICE: some keyboards that did not work previously can now be used, but without the use of LEDs.
  ### This condition is normal for SM-X and SX-2 machines that do not yet have the hardware patch on the PS/2 port.
- Improved T80 core in which a bug that prevented the Lilly's Saga game from working properly was fixed, by HRA!
- Careful SEED selection for the 1st Gen machines was carried out through the collaboration of Emiliano Olea Lucas.

v3.9.1 [2022.09.24] [KdL's Updates!]

- This is the first official firmware for MSX++ machines, the MSX++ logo is now the default logo for the 1chipMSX
  and replace the previous unofficial MSX3 logo. The other homebrew machines will continue to show their own logo.
- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 11:
  new Dynamic Port 4B that extends the I/O capacity by an additional 254 sub-ports based on the value of port $44;
  new smart command "Reserve OCM-BIOS Reloading" useful for managing several SDBIOS without turning off the power;
  new Extra-Mapper 4096kB on Slot0-1 actionable by GETRESET or SETSMART commands for all machines with at least
  16MB SDRAM, the size of system RAM can now be selected from 2048kB, 4096kB, 6144kB and 8192kB;
  new Internal PSG2 (acting as an external PSG) for 2nd Gen machines only, PSG2 logic was implemented by Ducasp;
  improved access to tPANA on port $41 ID $08, so that the 5.37 MHz cpu clock is handled properly by most programs.
- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder, added the "startup processing v3.9.1" by HRA!, which explains
  the meaning of the new icons that appear at pre-boot: by reading it you can have a better user experience!
- Updated 'mglocm.com' v2.3b (2022.09.11) in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder with the Internal PSG2, by ToughkidCST.
- Updated 'vgmplay.com' v1.3 (final release) in the [msxtools\vgmplay\] folder, by Grauw.
- Updated 'mpcm.com' v1.07 in the [msxtools\mpcm\] folder which officially includes a new OCM patch, by Niga.
  For those who prefer to use their own external memory mappers, the previous MPCM v1.06 is recommended.
- Updated and revised all the scripts to compile and collect firmware, improving reliability and performance.
- New 'testinap.asc' tool in the [msxtools\diags\] folder, allows you to test pull-up resistors of external slots.
- New and improved MegaSD (SD controller) in Verilog with support for initialization in fast or slow mode, by HRA!
- New IPL-ROM 3.00, the Initial Program Loader has changed and includes the new pre-boot icons, there is a new way
  of loading SDBIOS which is now based on the filename, the possibility of activating multiple SDBIOS on the same
  SD card, better error checking, many months of testing and modification by HRA! with my collaboration.
- New PS/2 keyboard controller in Verilog by HRA!, improved stability and recognition of keyboards but in some
  cases a hardware patch will be needed on 2nd Gen machines (SM-X and SX-2), see documentation.
- Improved and revised keymap ROM tables, the new Italian layout is only precompiled for 2nd Gen machines, I fixed
  each layout by creating a spreadsheet that you can find in the [esemsx3\src\peripheral\keymap_work\] folder.
- Improved the Internal OPL3 for the 2nd Gen machines, IRQ and scaler timer have been fixed, and in addition,
  mono audio has been reprogrammed to achieve small space in the FPGA, by Ducasp.
- Improved SDRAM controller to support chips smaller than 32MB, this changes made the design more flexible and
  extensible, the request came from Ducasp to implement his custom firmware.
- Improved I/O access times on the external bus at 10.74 MHz and fixed PS/2 mouse movement on the horizontal axis.
- Improved the reset button timer and fixed the logo speed limiter, the timings was reanalyzed and adjusted.
- Fixed some issues on PSG wave, turboR PCM Device, 5 Tap FIR low-pass filter, VDP R#8 and YJK modes, by HRA!
- Fixed the sound spikes on the speakers when pressing the reset button (at last!), the cause was the PWM reset.
- Optimizations and code cleanup, all shared variables were converted to logical signals, as suggested by uniabis.
- Quartus II v13.0sp1 Web Edition was updated to Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition v21.1.1 for the 2nd Gen machines.
- This version of OCM-PLD includes a total of fifty-four precompiled firmware variants.
  Firmware interchangeability groups are highlighted in the 'details.txt' of the [firmware\] folder, as usual.
  SM-X Mini firmware will no longer be available because I do not have the opportunity to test that machine myself.
  For those who want to venture into compilation, the code has been archived in [ocm_sm\legacy-smxmini391-src.zip].

Notes and warnings:
- To get the best out of these firmware, IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO USE THE MOST UP-TO-DATE OCM-EXTRA TOOLS.
  An example of a bug fixed: the first version of the FIRMINFO command displayed the wrong I/O revision number 31.
- Nextor kernel is unable to flash the PLD firmware using the old 'pldload.com' and the machine can be BRICKED!!
  The current 'pldflash.com' and 'smxflash.com' are the only ones to do this, be very careful when using them.
- Nextor can now automatically mount the SD card even if it has not been inserted into the slot before system boot.
- The most of Microcabin games can run better with the 'runit.com' tool, with 'ep.com' two drives are required.
  If you experience issues using SofaRun, you may need to increase the loading delay from the game settings.
- Most of the features of the MSX turboR have not yet been developed and are for testing purposes only. The MULU
  opcodes and System Timer (S1990) are no longer available on the 1st Gen machines due to the space limit reached.
- Currently, the MIDI interface is limited to the operation of the MIDRY software and very few others.
- Philips Music Module does not support the tMegaSD function and only works at 3.58MHz, run SETSMART -030B40 to go.
- The main cause of instability in the 1st Gen machines is the option "Force Use of Synchronous Clear Signals".
  This option was introduced in OCM-PLD v2.4 and currently cannot be disabled due to running out of resources.
  In the 2nd Gen machines this option has been disabled and will not be used, so they are much more stable.
  Since this new generation does not need more space yet, the compression of the SOF has also been disabled.
  If necessary, it will still be possible to activate it by modifying the structure of the COF in this way:
  "<sof_filename>output_files/ocm_sm.sof<compress_bitstream>1</compress_bitstream></sof_filename>".
- On the 1st Gen machines the hard reset lock function does not work with cartridges due to a hardware limitation.
  A hardware patch can be made by isolating pin 15 of the slots from the reset button and connecting it to pin 16.
  This patch also requires custom firmware with the appropriate changes, so I do NOT recommend its use.
- The ESP8266 Wi-Fi BIOS has NOT been integrated into EPBIOS because its full maturity has not yet been reached.
- When Extra-Mapper 4096kB is enabled, you may encounter anomalies or system crashes with some software, as is the
  case with Micro Music v3.1, but this depends on how they were programmed. MPCM can handle all that RAM.

Some known issues:
- The sprites disable and enable after three lines instead of after one line, reported by Grauw and Andre.
- Some PSG sounds are not played accurately and sometimes the OPLL drum kit sounds too loud.
- The current version of MSX turboR BIOS can be started with Internal Mapper 4096kB only using Nextor kernel
  and generates some issues with the PSG output (simply just listen to the beep sound to confirm it).
- DIX game won't start due to INT_n inaccuracy, a temporary patch can run it by changing 00293h from C8h to 00h.
- The CMT input on 1st Gen machines causes an increase in video noise of VGA modes, slightly affecting luminance.

v3.9 [2021.08.23] [KdL's Updates!]

- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 10:
  new features dedicated to 2nd Gen machines, so SM-X and SX-2 can control Internal OPL3 and VGA Scalines.
  Removed the signal called "ZemmixNeo" in order to make the specification less constrained to the type of machine.
- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder, including the "hardware patches to 2020.10.16" now summarized.
- Updated 'mglocm.com' v2.2a (2021.08.11) in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder.
- Updated jic2pld converter which now allows you to auto-adapt the input files for EPCS16 and higher devices.
- Updated and revised all the scripts to compile and collect firmware. The 'zz5_set_synthesis_seed.cmd' script
  is used on the 1st Gen machines to generate random variants needed to re-enter when space limits are exceeded.
  Using this script also allows you to find better solutions than others, thus achieving system stability.
- New RESET model rewritten and parsed from zero. The new method improves the compatibility of external cartridges.
  Three actions are available: a short click <1s for a quick reset; a long click >1s that reloads SDBIOS; a click
  during the initial blinking allows you to cancel SDBIOS and force the use of EPBIOS without removing the SD card.
- New Autofire module, a function suggested by Konamiman currently only available for 2nd Gen machines, by HRA!
  The list of special keys has been updated as usual in the 'details.txt' of the [firmware\] folder.
- New F2 device designed by me to manage the operating states of the ESP8266 Wi-Fi BIOS implemented by Ducasp.
- Improved Wi-Fi module with Quick Receive support by Ducasp, LFSR counter and some minor optimizations.
- Improved System Timer (S1990) module with LFSR counter and reset command, based on the HRA! project.
- Improved and fixed RTC module by HRA! with some changes made by me like LFSR counter and rtcena signal.
- Improved some critical counters, now they are programmed separately if XTAL is 21.47727MHz or 50.00000MHz.
- Improved VDP wait controller, LMMV is reverted to normal speed in accordance with the current VDP update.
- Improved VDP R#23 for the text modes and added support for TEXTQ and MULTIQ modes, by HRA!
- Optimized turboR PCM Device with LFSR counter.
- Optimized CMT control on 2nd Gen machines, the SCRLK key has been re-mapped as a toggle for the Internal OPL3.
- Added Wi-Fi support for 1st Gen machines. A special USB Wi-Fi Header/Dongle with ESP-01 can then be connected to
  the USB port-1 of 1chipMSX, Zemmix Neo and SX-1 (the USB port-2 is used for the USB keyboard on some Zemmix Neo).
- Fixed damaged graphics in Fighter's Ragnarök game thanks to a bug fix in VDP R#17 management, by HRA!
  This fix solves various issues and allows you to successfully run games with the animated Sunrise logo.
- Separation of the T800 from the T80 thinking about the future R800 clone.
- Restructuring of the [ocm_sm\] folder now designed to quickly managed new 2nd Gen machines.
- Cleaned up the source code from parts of unused code and countless optimizations to reduce space.
- The firmware list has reached a total of sixty builds with the new SX-1 Mini/Mini+, SX-2 and SM-X Mini machines.
  Firmware interchangeability groups are now highlighted in the 'details.txt' of the [firmware\] folder.


v3.8.1 [2020.05.23] [KdL's Updates!]

- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder and added the "hardware patch 2020.04.06" which shows which pull-up
  resistors must be replaced in the defective machines, in order to correctly use the external cartridges.
- Added MIDI output on joystick port-2 of the 1chipMSX and Zemmix Neo machines, a preliminary version like SM-X.
- Fixed the direction of the data bus on SM-X, now the external PSG cartridges work well, tested by ToughkidCST.
- The firmware are interchangeable only by machine type, therefore DO NOT mix 1chipMSX, Zemmix Neo and SM-X.

v3.8 [2020.01.09] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated all keyboard layouts by adding KANA/CODE to the [MENU] key and fixed the assignment of [SHIFT+F6].

  new [SHIFT+PGUP/PGDOWN] keys to do the fast switch of master volume from max level to middle, min and mute;
  new "Pixel Ratio 1:1 for VGA Output" (scmd-$7F) a trick to get the correct pixel ratio on a non-CRT display
  (e.g. A:\>SETSMART -7F7F7F7F is fine for a VX2835WM); fixed scmd-$F9 to allow the use of an external FM-PAC;
  new scmd-$D6/D7 that allow to force the centering of YJK modes and VDP R#25 mask (useful for MSX2+ games).
- Updated DIP-SW User Manual in the [docs\] folder.
- New 'mglocm.com' and 'mglunch.com' (2017.11.18) in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder.
- New audio mixer that improve the amplitude of internal sounds and balance the input line of external slots:
  global audio starts at level 10 out of 13 to avoid clipping for at least two internal chips at a time;
  to reduce the audio noise, I suggest setting everything to the max level and an external mixer volume of 80%.
- Improved timings of VDP command engine, the intros of Fray and Space Manbow are okay now but I emphasize that
  the wait control does not calculate the actual times of the VDP commands, which still makes it inaccurate.
- Improved VGA output to help directly set a pixel ratio 1:1 on a LED TV at 60Hz (also w/o the trick scmd-$7F).
- Added MULUB and MULUW opcodes in the T80 core: MSX turboR BIOS is required to use them, by TobiFlex.
- Fixed random sprites during the blank screen (ref. Manbow 2) and fixed H-SYNC signal (ref. Unknown Reality).
- Fixed the border color of YJK modes (SCREEN 10, 11 and 12) that should has been palettized.
- Fixed the horizontal position of YJK modes by +4 pixels on the right.
- In this release NOT all Zemmix Neo firmware are interchangeable with each other, a special note is with them.

- There are many PLDs in this package, choose the one you like from the [firmware\] folder.

Notes and warnings:
- The main intent of this release is to open the road for OCM to evolve in a MSX turboR machine and which is why
  I deliberately avoided the addition of less-used new components (ESE-RAMdisk, RS-232 and MOUSE PS/2 adapter).
- OCM-SDBIOS v1.9.2 or earlier is no longer supported by now and OCM-SDBIOS v2.0 or later is needed to have fun.

Notes:
- The Nextor kernel will be natively supported by future releases.
- Sometimes random glitches or other strange issues could be caused by the optimizations of Quartus II.
  In these situations it is suggested to recompile the project by replacing 'emsx_top.qsf' (balanced technique)
  with the alternive 'emsx_top.qsf.area'.
- Some games go to black screen using 'ep.com'. I suggest to enable two disk drives via 'eset.com' and retry.
