How to Perform a Firmware Update
================================

Choose a firmware by machine type, keyboard layout and EPBIOS type from the available variants, then proceed as below.
You can also run the 'pld_collector.cmd' script to quickly collect the firmware and easily put it on the SD card.


1st Gen Machines
----------------
For 1chipMSX, Zemmix Neo, SX-1 (regular) and SX-1 Mini/Mini+,
  copy the 'emsx_top.pld' file into the same folder as 'flash.bat' and 'pldflash.com' files,
  then run these command lines from MSX-DOS 2 or NEXTOR:

A:\>FLASH EMSX_TOP.PLD
  or
A:\>FLASH EMSX_TOP.PLD #1A2B3C  (the optional second parameter is for "Custom Setup")
  or
A:\>SET EXPERT ON
A:\>PLDFLASH EMSX_TOP.PLD
A:\>SETSMART #1A2B3C  (optional)

At the end of the procedure, it will be necessary to turn off the machine to make the changes.


2nd Gen Machines
----------------
For SM-X (regular), SX-2 and SX-E (not in multicore mode),
  copy the 'ocm_sm.pld' file into the same folder as 'xflash.bat' and 'smxflash.com' files,
  then run these command lines from MSX-DOS 2 or NEXTOR:

A:\>XFLASH OCM_SM.PLD
  or
A:\>XFLASH OCM_SM.PLD #1A2B3C  (the optional second parameter is for "Custom Setup")
  or
A:\>SET EXPERT ON
A:\>SMXFLASH OCM_SM.PLD
A:\>SETSMART #1A2B3C  (optional)

At the end of the procedure, it will be necessary to turn off the machine to make the changes.


Custom Setup
------------
Starting with OCM-PLD v3.9.2, an additional update process has been made available that allows saving a series of smart commands
to the EPCS so they are executed upon machine startup. This process can be carried out during the firmware flash or at a later time
using the SETSMART command.

As in the previous examples, use a '#' prefix to flash the sequence of smart commands. Pay attention to the order of insertion, which
will be executed from left to right, as any conflicting commands may overwrite previous ones. The smart commands that are normally
activated only after a Warm Reset will instead have an immediate effect, such as SETSMART #57FC or SETSMART #57FE.

The data will be saved in the IGX Smart Profile, which involves erasing and rewriting a part of the EPCS. Therefore, avoid using
the flash command in AUTOEXEC.BAT or any repetitive batch file to prevent a rapid exhaustion of the number of rewrites.
This precaution is not necessary for the '-' or '/' prefixes of SETSMART as they do not perform the device flash.

A max of 59 hex codes are accepted. To cancel any previously entered sequence, execute SETSMART #00 (the default value) or flash the
device again without specifying smart commands. Should the device lock due to an incorrect sequence, you can temporarily restore its
default settings by entering Safe Mode, i.e., simply hold down the [DEL] key during startup or immediately after a Full Reset.

Finally, while flashing the firmware requires a complete shutdown of the machine, changing the IGX Smart Profile with SETSMART simply
requires a Cold Reset or a Full Reset. This simplifies the process of updating the stored smart commands.


*********************************************************************
WARNING!! DO NOT TURN OFF THE DEVICE UNTIL THE FLASH PROCESS IS DONE.

A corrupted PLD file might cause your system to FAIL!
Any damages caused by improper operations of updating the firmware is at your own risk. Please be responsible.

Using incorrect firmware, you may need to use the recovery procedures as described below.

   For SX-1 (regular) and SX-1 Mini/Mini+, check out the provided documentation or ask to the manufacturer.

4. Run the programmer and power on the device, select "Active Serial Programming" method to load a dedicated 'recovery.pof' file.


Recovery Guide for SM-X (regular), SX-2 and SX-E
================================================

Here is how to flash the device after a failed update using a personal computer with Windows OS.

1. Buy and install a compatible download cable for 'EPCS4' like USB ByteBlaster.

2. Download and install Stand-Alone Intel Quartus Prime Programmer and Tools 24.1std.0.1077 (free):
https://downloads.intel.com/akdlm/software/acdsinst/24.1std/1077/ib_installers/QuartusProgrammerSetup-24.1std.0.1077-windows.exe

3. For SM-X (regular), go to the bottom and attach the cable on the JTAG connector with the pin-1 towards the front of device.
   For SX-2 and SX-E, check out the provided documentation or ask their respective manufacturers.

4. Run the programmer and power on the device, select "JTAG" method to load a dedicated 'recovery.jic' file.
