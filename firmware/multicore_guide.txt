Multicore Quick Guide
=====================

Some machines, such as the SX-E, can operate in two ways: the classic mode, which involves loading the PLD file, and the
alternative mode, which currently runs RBF files. Creating RBF files requires some precautions, follow these guidelines.


Instructions for Creating a Valid RBF File
------------------------------------------
1. Copy 'iplrom_512k.v' from [esemsx3\src\peripheral\iplrom3_work\] and overwrite it in [ocm_sm\src\addons\peripheral\].

2. Open Quartus Prime Lite Edition, load the 'ocm_sm' project (i.e., SX-E), compile it, and upon completion, verify that
   an RBF file has been generated in the output folder.

3. Ensure the SD card is formatted in FAT16. Copy the generated RBF file and rename it with the SXE extension.
   Currently, the RBF file cannot contain an EPBIOS, therefore also add a valid 'OCM-BIOS.DAT' file to the SD card.
   At this point, you are ready to boot multicore and load the SXE file.


Important Note
--------------
Due to the lack of general compatibility among multicore machines, this package does not include pre-assembled RBF cores.
