List of DIP-SW and Special Keys (v3.9.2)
========================================
GAMING-SPACEBAR     <=  [WIN]
GRAPH               <=  [F6] or [LALT]
KANA/CODE           <=  [F7] or [MENU]
SELECT              <=  [F8]
CTRL                <=  [LCTRL]
CPU Clock           <=  [F12] or [DIP-SW1]
Video Output        <=  [(SHIFT+)PRTSCR] or [DIP-SW2/3]
Audio Mixer         <=  [(SHIFT+)PGUP/PGDOWN/F9/F10/F11]
Cartridge Slot-1    <=  [SHIFT+F12] or [DIP-SW4]
Cartridge Slot-2    <=  [SHIFT+SCRLK] or [DIP-SW5/6]
Internal Mapper     <=  [DIP-SW7] only
Internal MegaSD     <=  [DIP-SW8] only
Blackout Mode       <=  [PAUSE]
CMT                 <=  [SCRLK] on Cyclone I series     { 1chipMSX, Zemmix Neo (KR), Zemmix Neo BR, SX-1 (regular) and [SX-1 Mini/Mini+] }
Internal OPL3       <=  [SCRLK] on Cyclone IV-E series  { SM-X (regular) and SX-2 }

CANCEL              <=  [RALT]              If held down during BIOS loading, it will enable Slot0 in Primary mode.
EXECUTE             <=  [RCTRL]             If held down during BIOS loading, it will enable Extra-Mapper 4096KB.
                                            Since Extra-Mapper is located in Slot0-1, [RCTRL] cannot be used together with [RALT].

Cold Reset          <=  [LCTRL+SHIFT+F12]   It acts like the "GETRESET /C" command.
Warm Reset          <=  [LCTRL+F12]         It acts like the "GETRESET" command.
                                            Due to hardware limitations, these functions are unable to reset cartridges on 1st Gen machines.

System Reset        <=  [HARD RESET KEY]    Three actions are possible:
                                            1. with a short click you can perform a quick reset;
                                            2. with a long click you can reload SDBIOS or EPBIOS;
                                            3. with one more click you can cancel the loading of SDBIOS to start EPBIOS instead.
